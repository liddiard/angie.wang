*The following profile ran as part of "A Paper Trail," the ninth Daily Bruin reporting project funded by the [Bridget O'Brien Scholarship Foundation](http://rememberingbridget.com/). "A Paper Trail" aims to illustrate what it means to be an undocumented student in the United States – from California, where policies are relatively lenient, to Georgia, where students are subject to some of the nation's harshest higher education policies.

Victor Barragan chased down “the bad guys” on the cold, hard living room floors in his home, pretending to be a cop. At the age of three, he knew he wanted to be a police officer, and almost 20 years later, he’s still working toward that goal.

On weekdays, Barragan works 13-hour shifts at a granite company, trying to save up for college. He comes home to research which institutions offer admissions and financial aid to undocumented students, searching for any opportunity to pursue an education in law enforcement.

For Barragan, a typical game of hide-and-seek ends with his younger brother in handcuffs. Barragan asks his brother to hide around the house, and times himself to see how long he needs to search the place. On Saturdays, Barragan practices using a gun at a shooting range with a friend. And at the end of August, he began to spend his Sundays at Freedom University.

Barragan and about 50 other students study as part of the university – a nonprofit organization that provides college-level education to undocumented students in Georgia. Some Freedom University students also partake in activism, protesting the University System of Georgia’s Board of Regents’ policy that bans undocumented students from the top five public universities in the state.

Barragan said he has always been a quiet student, but intends to become an activist after settling in at Freedom University to stand up for people like himself who think they can’t be heard.

He said he wants to transform himself from a boy who always sat in the back of the room into an officer who is proud to take part in the action. He said he hoped to serve with the Marines as a military police officer after graduating high school, and then study at a four-year university before entering into the police force.

“I’ve always wanted to be a Marine, to be a part of the fight,” he said.

But being an undocumented student drastically slowed his path to becoming a police officer. He wasn’t eligible for training programs that would put him through college, and was turned away even when current police officers recommended him for the police academy.

“Every door I opened was shut in my face,” Barragan said.

During his last year of middle school, Barragan lost his way. He was enrolled in a continuation school for students who had too many infractions, and showed up for class every morning in uniform – a collared shirt, khaki pants and black shoes.

When he was 18, Barragan heard news that his uncle had been shot after being at the wrong place at the wrong time. He looked at the negative influences in his life, and was terrified his own life would end before he fulfilled his dream of becoming a cop.

Barragan began to take school seriously again. He improved his grades, became close with his teachers and enrolled in the Police Explorer Program in Gwinnett County, Georgia. The program teaches students the basics of being an officer – how to handcuff, hold a weapon, read Miranda rights and make felony stops.

The program’s officers welcomed him with open arms, even after Barragan revealed his undocumented status. They acknowledged the obstacles he would encounter, but promised they would help him become an officer if he obtained legal status.

Barragan said he wants to be a police officer to support his family and recognize the risks his parents have taken for him and his siblings. His mother hasn’t seen her family in Mexico in over a decade, and his father works long hours in roofing.

“He comes home tired and dirty, and I don’t want to see him like that anymore,” Barragan said. “It’s time for me to give back.”
